The built-in L2 interop composability is intentional because it offsets the critical gameplay to a blockchain that is architected for this type of interaction, while preserving the security afforded by L1. The additional benefits go much further however, because we can facilitate and ramp the transition of NFT Investors and their capital into Arbitrum and the Treasure ecosystem. The diagram below outlines many of the components of this ecosystem design.","sidebar":"washipaper"},"washipaper/game-design":{"id":"washipaper/game-design","title":"Game Design","description":"The game design modeled here represents the complete Game Loop that takes place over a year in game terms (4 months in IRL terms). The detail here is purposefully lighter because we are targeting the release of these game mechanics across the 2nd and 3rd phases of our Roadmap.","sidebar":"washipaper"},"washipaper/game-roles":{"id":"washipaper/game-roles","title":"Game Roles","description":"Game Theory works well in an environment that possesses many options for gameplay and scarce resources to do it with. This optionality is critical for enriching experiences, but we also want to be mindful of our role as a gameFI protocol, and rewarding everyone for their engagement and dedication. By doubling down on the element of social coordination, by providing a platform and design for intense factional competition. We can\'t wait to observe each faction self-organizing and coordinating around a common set of goals - to have fun and to reap the economic rewards.","sidebar":"washipaper"},"washipaper/guiding-principles":{"id":"washipaper/guiding-principles","title":"Guiding Principles","description":"Chain Agnostic","sidebar":"washipaper"},"washipaper/introduction":{"id":"washipaper/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"The Lost SamuRise is a faction based strategy game played in the fictional world of Tengoku (heaven) that has borrowed lore and stylistic elements from Samurai culture in classical Japan. Our GameFi protocol is designed to be interoperable across the entire Ethereum-L2 ecosystem, but we have chosen to enter Arbitrum and join Treasure\u2019s emerging metaverse as part of our initial phase of delivery.","sidebar":"washipaper"},"washipaper/metaverse-layer":{"id":"washipaper/metaverse-layer","title":"Metaverse Layer","description":"The Metaverse Layer is where identity and experience converge.

Paying as much attention to the design as to the incentives structure that drive human behaviour, is critical for any economy to thrive. A positive reinforcing system is notable for its self-sustaining market equilibrium that scales well with increasing liquidity and engagement. In other words, can we attract and retain market participants in our gameFI protocol, and reward them with $FUN and $YIELD?","sidebar":"washipaper"}}}')}}]);
